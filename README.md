My Action Figure management system will allow users to login to their own accounts and display their own collection on the home page. Users will be able to add and delete figures from their collections and click on each one to display the specifications of each. 

There are many different collectable management systems however, majority of them are bound to their own company. For example, ‘Popspedia’ (a mobile phone app) allows users to exclusively add figures that are branded “Funko Pop”. My management system will allow users to enter any collectable they choose and store it, keeping all collectibles in one common area.
